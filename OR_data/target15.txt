Universal Credit: How to claim - GOV.UK
How to claim
You can apply for Universal Credit online. You need to create an account to make a claim. You must complete your claim within 28 days of creating your account or you will have to start again. Your claim starts on the date you submit it in your account.
If you live with your partner, you will both need to create accounts. You'll link them together when you claim. You cannot claim by yourself.
If you cannot claim online, you can claim by phone through the Universal Credit helpline.
Check if you're better off on Universal Credit before you apply
If you already get benefits or tax credits, you should work out if you'll be better off before you or your partner claim Universal Credit. If you apply for Universal Credit those benefits might end and you will not be able to apply for them again, even if your application is not approved.
What you need to apply
To apply online you'll need:
*your bank, building society or credit union account details
*an email address
*access to a phone
You'll also have to prove your identity. You'll need some identity documents for this, for example your:

To complete your claim you will need to provide information about:
*your housing, for example how much rent you pay

*any disability or health condition that affects your work
*how much you pay for childcare if you want help with childcare costs
*your savings and any investments, like shares or a property that you rent out
You might need an appointment with the Universal Credit team if:

You'll be told if this appointment will be in a jobcentre or on the phone. You will have to go to a meeting to agree the activities in your claimant commitment before you can get your first payment.

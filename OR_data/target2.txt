Universal Credit: How to claim - GOV.UK

How to claim:
You can apply for Universal Credit online.
You need to create an account to make a claim. You must complete your claim within 28 days of creating your account or you will have to start again. Your claim starts on the date you submit it in your account.
If you live with your partner, you will both need to create accounts. You’ll link them together when you claim. You cannot claim by yourself.
If you cannot claim online, you can claim by phone through the Universal Credit helpline.

Check if you’re better off on Universal Credit before you apply:
*If you already get benefits or tax credits, you should work out if you’ll be better off before you or your partner claim Universal Credit.
*If you apply for Universal Credit those benefits might end and you will not be able to apply for them again, even if your application is not approved.

To check if you’re better off, you can:
*use a benefits calculator
*contact the Citizens Advice Help to Claim service
*ask a local benefits adviser

What you need to apply:
To apply online you’ll need:

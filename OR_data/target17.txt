Universal Credit: Report a change of circumstances - GOV.UK
You need to report changes to your circumstances to keep getting the right amount each month. Report changes as soon as they happen to avoid overpayments and potential repayments.
Changes to report include:

Finding or finishing a job
Having a child
Moving in with your partner
Starting to care for a child or disabled person
Changing contact details or address
Changing bank details
Rent changes
Health condition changes
Becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach
Changes to earnings (self-employed only)
Changes to savings, investments, and money
Changes to immigration status

How to report:
Sign in to your Universal Credit account to report changes.
If you get a job or increase work hours:

Use a benefits calculator or speak with your work coach
Most employers report earnings for you
Self-employed individuals usually need to report monthly earnings

Overpayments:
You may have to repay if you:

Didn't report a change immediately
Gave incorrect information
Were overpaid by mistake

If you're nearing the end of life:

You may get extra money
Report changes as usual if you have more than 12 months to live
If you have 12 months or less to live, report online or have someone report for you using form SR1
No Work Capability Assessment is needed in this case

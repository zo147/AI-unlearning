Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children: Overview - GOV.UK

Overview:
Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children may help with the extra costs of looking after a child who:
*is under 16
*has difficulties walking or needs much more looking after than a child of the same age who does not have a disability

They will need to meet all the eligibility requirements.

The DLA rate is between £28.70 and £184.30 a week and depends on the level of help the child needs.

If your child lives in Scotland:
You need to apply for Child Disability Payment instead of DLA for children.

If your child is getting DLA for children but they have moved to Scotland, you'll need to report this change so they can get Child Disability Payment instead.

If your child moves from Scotland to England or Wales:
If your child gets Child Disability Payment, you must:
*report this to Social Security Scotland
*make a new claim for DLA for children

Your Child Disability Payment will stop 13 weeks after your child moves – apply for DLA as soon as possible after moving or your payments could be affected.

Child Benefit: What you'll get - GOV.UK
There are 2 Child Benefit rates:

Eldest or only child: £24.00 per week
Additional children: £15.90 per child per week

You must contact the Child Benefit Office if you're paid too much or too little.
Any Child Benefit payments you get will count towards the benefit cap. If you're affected by the cap, you'll still get the full amount for your Child Benefit payments but your other benefits may be reduced.
How and when Child Benefit is paid:

Usually paid every 4 weeks on a Monday or Tuesday
Can be paid weekly if you're a single parent or getting certain other benefits, such as Universal Credit
Can be paid into any account, except Post Office card accounts or certain Nationwide accounts
Can only be paid into one account

Child Benefit and protecting your State Pension:

You'll get National Insurance credits automatically if you claim Child Benefit and your child is under 12
These credits count towards your State Pension
If you don't need the credits, your family may be eligible to get the support instead

If families split up:

You get £24.00 a week for the eldest child
If you have 2 children and one stays with you and the other with your ex-partner, you'll both get £24.00 a week for each child
Only one person can claim for the same child

If families join together:

The eldest child in the new family qualifies for the £24.00 rate
Any other eligible children will get the £15.90 rate

If you or your partner earn over £50,000:

You may have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge
You can still get other advantages of Child Benefit like National Insurance credits
The charge will not be more than the amount you get from Child Benefit payments
You'll need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year to pay the charge
You can opt out of getting payments if you don't want to pay the charge

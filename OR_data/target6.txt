Child Benefit: How it works - GOV.UK

How it works:
You get Child Benefit if you're responsible for bringing up a child who is:
*under 16
*under 20 if they stay in approved education or training

Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. There's no limit to how many children you can claim for.

By claiming Child Benefit, you can get:
*an allowance paid to you for each child - you'll usually get it every 4 weeks
*National Insurance credits which count towards your State Pension
*a National Insurance number for your child without them having to apply for one - they'll usually get the number shortly before they turn 16 years old

If you choose not to get Child Benefit payments, you should still make a claim to get the other advantages.

If your circumstances change:
You must report any change of circumstances to the Child Benefit Office.

Universal Credit: Eligibility - GOV.UK

Eligibility
You may be able to get Universal Credit if you’re on a low income or need help with your living costs. You could be:
*out of work
*working (including self-employed or part time)
*unable to work, for example because of a health condition

To claim you must:
*live in the UK
*be aged 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you’re 16 to 17)
*be under State Pension age
*have £16,000 or less in money, savings and investments
You can use a benefits calculator to check what benefits you could get.

If you’re an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen you and your family might also need settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme to get Universal Credit. Check if you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.

If you live with your partner, you will both need to claim for Universal Credit. You must make a joint claim for your household, even if your partner is not eligible. How much you can get will depend on your partner’s income and savings, as well as your own. If only one of you has reached State Pension age, you and your partner can still claim Universal Credit as a couple. Your Universal Credit claim will stop when you both reach State Pension age.
If you’re getting Pension Credit, it will stop if you or your partner make a claim for Universal Credit. You’ll usually be better off staying on Pension Credit. You can check using a benefits calculator.

If you’re studying or in training, you can make a claim for Universal Credit if you’re in full-time education and any of the following apply:
*you live with your partner and they’re eligible for Universal Credit
*you’re responsible for a child, either as a single person or as a couple
*you’ve reached State Pension age and live with a partner who is below State Pension age
You can also claim Universal Credit if you’re 21 or under, studying any qualification up to A level or equivalent and do not have parental support.
You may be able to claim if you are studying part-time or doing a course for which no student loan or finance is available.
Check the guidance about claiming Universal Credit as a student.

Students with disabilities or health conditions can claim Universal Credit if you’re in full-time education, and have been assessed as having limited capability for work by a Work Capability Assessment before starting your course. You must also be entitled to any of the following:
*Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
*Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
*Child Disability Payment (CDP) in Scotland
*Attendance Allowance
*Armed Forces Independence Payment
*Adult Disability Payment (ADP) in Scotland

Claiming if you’re 16 or 17: 
You can make a claim for Universal Credit if any of the following apply:
*you have a health condition or disability and have medical evidence for it, such as a fit note
*you’re caring for a severely disabled person

*you’re pregnant and expecting your baby in the next 11 weeks

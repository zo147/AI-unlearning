Universal Credit: What Universal Credit is - GOV.UK

What Universal Credit is:
Universal Credit is a payment to help with your living costs. It’s paid monthly - or twice a month for some people in Scotland.
You may be able to get it if you’re on a low income, out of work or you cannot work.
Sign in to your Universal Credit account if you already have one.

If you already get other benefits:
Universal Credit is replacing the following benefits and tax credits:
*Child Tax Credit
*Housing Benefit
*Income Support
*income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
*income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
*Working Tax Credit
If you’re getting any of these benefits or tax credits, you do not need to do anything unless either:
*your circumstances change
*you get a letter called a ‘Migration Notice’ telling you that you must claim Universal Credit

If you get a Migration Notice, you must move to Universal Credit within 3 months to keep getting financial support.
You’ll stop getting these benefits and tax credits when you or your partner claim Universal Credit. If you or your partner gets Pension Credit, this will also stop if one of you claims Universal Credit.
You’ll continue getting any other benefits you already receive, such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) or Carer’s Allowance.

You can read more about how tax credits and Universal Credit affect each other.
If you get certain other benefits at the same time as Universal Credit, the amount of Universal Credit you receive will be reduced.

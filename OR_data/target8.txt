Child Benefit: Eligibility - GOV.UK

Eligibility:
Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. You normally qualify for Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 and you live in the UK.

You'll usually be responsible for a child if either:
*you live with them
*you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after them - for example on food, clothes or pocket money

Eligibility rules are different if your child:
*goes into hospital or care
*lives with someone else

If your child is 16 or over:
You'll normally still qualify for Child Benefit if your child is under 20 and they stay in approved education or training.

You can apply for Child Benefit to continue for 20 weeks if a 16 or 17 year old leaves education or training and registers with either:
*a government-sponsored careers service
*the armed services

Fostering a child:
You'll get Child Benefit if you foster a child, as long as the local council is not paying anything towards their accommodation or maintenance.

Adopting a child:
You can claim Child Benefit as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you - you do not have to wait until the adoption process is complete.

Looking after someone else's child:
You may be able to get Child Benefit if you've got an informal arrangement to look after a friend or relative's child.

Living abroad:
You may be able to get Child Benefit if you go to live in certain countries or if you're a Crown servant.

If you have settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme:
If you have settled status, you can claim Child Benefit.

If you have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme:
You can claim Child Benefit if any of the following apply:
*You're working and earning above the primary threshold for employees paying National Insurance for 3 continuous months
*You're looking for work (for up to 91 days)
*You have sufficient resources to support yourself financially
*You're studying and have sufficient resources to support yourself financially
*You're a family member of an EEA or Swiss national who has a right to reside

If your child starts work or gets benefits in their own right:
You'll stop getting Child Benefit if your child:
*starts paid work for 24 hours or more a week and is no longer in approved education or training
*starts an apprenticeship in England
*starts getting certain benefits, such as Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit

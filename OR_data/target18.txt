Universal Credit: Other financial support - GOV.UK
Other financial support
If you're in financial difficulties, you can get help and advice from the government, local councils and other organisations.
Advance and hardship payments
*If you do not have enough to live on while you wait for your first payment you can ask for an advance payment after you've made a claim.
*You can also ask for a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or hygiene needs because you got a sanction.
*You need to pay it back through your Universal Credit payments - they'll be lower until you pay it back.
Change how you get your Universal Credit
If you're having financial difficulties or you're behind on your rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA). Depending on your circumstances, you could get an APA to:
*get your rent paid directly to your landlord
*get paid more frequently than once a month
*receive split payments, if you're part of a couple
Speak to your work coach to apply for an APA.
Budgeting Advance
You might be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help with:
*emergency household costs such as replacing a broken cooker
*getting a job or staying in work
*funeral costs
You'll repay it through your regular Universal Credit payments - these will be lower until you pay it back. If you stop getting Universal Credit, you'll have to repay the money in another way.
How much you can borrow
The smallest amount you can borrow is £100. You can get up to:
*£348 if you're single

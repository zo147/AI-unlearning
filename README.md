# Machine Unlearning for Responsible AI

## Acknowledgment

This project builds on the benchmark framework introduced by [Majithia et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632) and is based on their original repository: [DCAI_ODI_GovAsADataProvider](https://github.com/NevadaM/DCAI_ODI_GovAsADataProvider).

From their readme: This repo provides the data and code underlying the experiments presented in [this technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632), summarised and discussed in the ODI report "The UK government as a data provider for AI" ([link](https://theodi.org/insights/reports/the-uk-government-as-a-data-provider-for-ai/)) - a piece that analyses what the results of the experiments mean in the wider context of government-enabled AI development and provides recommendations for the UK to take forward in the coming years."

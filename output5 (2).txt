*Units are supported by non-medical personnel like Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) Practitioners and chaplains
*Treatment options include unit medical centres or referral to specialist mental healthcare services
*Specialist services are delivered through 16 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) across the UK and overseas
*Available treatments include medication, psychological therapies, social support, and environmental changes

Reservists:
